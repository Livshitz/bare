# x-css

x-css is a minimalist, semantic CSS library designed specifically for LLM-friendly UI generation. It provides a set of basic, expressive styles that focus primarily on layouts and structure, with additional utility classes for common needs.

The library aims to be:

- **Simple**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Semantic**: Class names clearly indicate their purpose
- **Expressive**: Provides enough styling options without overwhelming complexity
- **LLM-optimized**: Designed to be easily understood by language models for automated UI generation

x-css serves as a foundation for AI-assisted UI development, allowing LLMs to efficiently generate structured, well-designed interfaces by referencing this documentation.
